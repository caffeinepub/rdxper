  "summary": "The diff implements both REQ-11 (bar graph styling) and REQ-12 (table styling) to match SPSS output aesthetics. Bar graphs now feature thin horizontal gridlines, Arial sans-serif fonts, muted SPSS-style colors (#4472C4, #70AD47), minimal spacing, and no shadows/gradients. Tables display thin consistent borders (#D0D0D0), subtle gray header backgrounds (#F5F5F5), Arial fonts, right-aligned numeric values, left-aligned text values, and no rounded corners. All acceptance criteria appear to be met.",
